          'Shogi4, also called 4x4 Shogi, is a drop-shogi played with animal tiles on a 4×4 board. It plays much like ordinary shogi shrunk to sixteen squares: pieces step in marked directions, captured pieces switch sides and drop back into play, and you win by taking the king. The one rule shogi players won\'t recognize is that a piece may hop over a friendly piece, added so your own pieces don\'t jam each other on a board this small.',
