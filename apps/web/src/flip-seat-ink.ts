// recorded result, the timeline's `color`, and the participant rows are all
// SEAT-keyed. Half of all flip games bind the opposite way round, so a raw seat used
// as a color is wrong half the time rather than merely inconsistent.

// This module is the seat -> ink map alone, deliberately import-light: a caller that

// -label module, and the two label modules should not each keep their own copy of the
