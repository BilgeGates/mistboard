// Rating store — the persistence surface for the human PvP Glicko-2 ladder.
//
// Carved out of persistence.ts as the rating concern got its own algorithm
// (glicko.ts). Follows the shell-helper-inversion pattern: this module takes the
// transaction client from persistence rather than owning the pool, so there's no
// circular import and the rating write stays inside the caller's game-end
// transaction. persistence.ts keeps shrinking; rating logic lives in one place.

 * Apply one finished rated PvP game to both players' Glicko-2 ratings, inside

 * each against the OPPONENT'S pre-game rating (simultaneous update), upserts the
 * new values, and records before/after rating+RD on game_participants (the
 * immutable per-game rating-event log).
